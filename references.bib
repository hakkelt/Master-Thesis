	abstract = {Compressed sensing is a new concept in signal processing where one seeks to minimize the number of measurements to be taken from signals while still retaining the information necessary to approximate them well. The ideas have their origins in certain abstract results from functional analysis and approximation theory by Kashin but were recently brought into the forefront by the work of Cand√®s, Romberg, and Tao and of Donoho who constructed concrete algorithms and showed their promise in application. There remain several fundamental questions on both the theoretical and practical sides of compressed sensing. This paper is primarily concerned with one of these theoretical issues revolving around just how well compressed sensing can approximate a given signal from a given budget of fixed linear measurements, as compared to adaptive linear measurements. More precisely, we consider discrete signals , allocate linear measurements of , and we describe the range of for which these measurements encode enough information to recover in the sense of to the accuracy of best -term approximation. We also consider the problem of having such accuracy only with high probability.},

Based on the premise that data acquisition and compression can be performed simultaneously, compressive sensing finds applications in imaging, signal processing, and many other domains. In the areas of applied mathematics, electrical engineering, and theoretical computer science, an explosion of research activity has already followed the theoretical results that highlighted the efficiency of the basic principles. The elegant ideas behind these principles are also of independent interest to pure mathematicians.A Mathematical Introduction to Compressive Sensing gives a detailed account of the core theory upon which the field is build. With only moderate prerequisites, it is an excellent textbook for graduate courses in mathematics, engineering, and computer science. It also serves as a reliable resource for practitioners and researchers in these disciplines who want to acquire a careful understanding of the subject.

	abstract = {Suppose we are given a vector f in a class {FsubeRopfN} , e.g., a class of digital signals or digital images. How many linear measurements do we need to make about f to be able to recover f to within precision epsi in the Euclidean (lscr2) metric? This paper shows that if the objects of interest are sparse in a fixed basis or compressible, then it is possible to reconstruct f to within very high accuracy from a small number of random measurements by solving a simple linear program. More precisely, suppose that the nth largest entry of the vector {\textbar}f{\textbar} (or of its coefficients in a fixed basis) obeys {\textbar}f{\textbar}(n){lesRmiddotn}-1p/, where R{\textgreater}0 and p{\textgreater}0. Suppose that we take measurements yk=langf\# ,Xkrang,k=1,...,K, where the Xk are N-dimensional Gaussian vectors with independent standard normal entries. Then for each f obeying the decay estimate above for some 0{\textless}p{\textless}1 and with overwhelming probability, our reconstruction ft, defined as the solution to the constraints yk=langf\# ,Xkrang with minimal lscr1 norm, obeys parf-f\#parlscr2lesCp {middotRmiddot}(K/{logN})-r, r=1/p-1/2. There is a sense in which this result is optimal; it is generally impossible to obtain a higher accuracy from any set of K measurements whatsoever. The methodology extends to various other random measurement ensembles; for example, we show that similar results hold if one observes a few randomly sampled Fourier coefficients of f. In fact, the results are quite general and require only two hypotheses on the measurement ensemble which are detailed.},

If x is known to be compressible by transform coding with a known transform, and we reconstruct via the nonlinear procedure defined here, the number of measurements n can be dramatically smaller than the size m. Thus, certain natural classes of images with m pixels need only n=O(m1/4log5/2(m)) nonadaptive nonpixel samples for faithful recovery, as opposed to the usual m pixel samples. More specifically, suppose x has a sparse representation in some orthonormal basis (e.g., wavelet, Fourier) or tight frame (e.g., curvelet, Gabor)-so the coefficients belong to an lscrp ball for 0{\textless}ples1. The N most important coefficients in that expansion allow reconstruction with lscr2 error O(N1/2-1p/). It is possible to design n=O(Nlog(m)) nonadaptive measurements allowing reconstruction with accuracy comparable to that attainable with direct knowledge of the N most important coefficients. Moreover, a good approximation to those N important coefficients is extracted from the n measurements by solving a linear program-Basis Pursuit in signal processing. The nonadaptive measurements have the character of "random" linear combinations of basis/frame elements. Our results use the notions of optimal recovery, of n-widths, and information-based complexity. We estimate the Gel'fand n-widths of lscrp balls in high-dimensional Euclidean space in the case 0{\textless}ples1, and give a criterion identifying near- optimal subspaces for Gel'fand n-widths. We show that "most" subspaces are near-optimal, and show that convex optimization (Basis Pursuit) is a near-optimal way to extract information derived from these near-optimal subspaces.},

Consider a discrete-time signal f/spl isin/C/sup N/ and a randomly chosen set of frequencies /spl Omega/. Is it possible to reconstruct f from the partial knowledge of its Fourier coefficients on the set /spl Omega/? A typical result of this paper is as follows. Suppose that f is a superposition of {\textbar}T{\textbar} spikes f(t)=/spl sigma//sub /spl tau//spl isin/T/f(/spl tau/)/spl delta/(t-/spl tau/) obeying {\textbar}T{\textbar}/spl les/C/sub M//spl middot/(log N)/sup -1/ /spl middot/ {\textbar}/spl Omega/{\textbar} for some constant C/sub M/{\textgreater}0. We do not know the locations of the spikes nor their amplitudes. Then with probability at least 1-O(N/sup -M/), f can be reconstructed exactly as the solution to the /spl lscr//sub 1/ minimization problem. In short, exact recovery may be obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. We give numerical values for C/sub M/ which depend on the desired probability of success. Our result may be interpreted as a novel kind of nonlinear sampling theorem. In effect, it says that any signal made out of {\textbar}T{\textbar} spikes may be recovered by convex programming from almost every set of frequencies of size O({\textbar}T{\textbar}/spl middot/{logN}). Moreover, this is nearly optimal in the sense that any method succeeding with probability 1-O(N/sup -M/) would in general require a number of frequency samples at least proportional to {\textbar}T{\textbar}/spl middot/{logN}. The methodology extends to a variety of other situations and higher dimensions. For example, we show how one can reconstruct a piecewise constant (one- or two-dimensional) object from incomplete frequency samples - provided that the number of jumps (discontinuities) obeys the condition above - by minimizing other convex functionals such as the total variation of f.},

	abstract = {Magnetic Resonance Imaging ({MRI}) is an essential technology in modern medicine. However, one of its main drawbacks is the long scan time needed to localize the {MR} signal in space to generate an image. This review article summarizes some basic principles and recent developments in parallel imaging, a class of image reconstruction techniques for shortening scan time. First, the fundamentals of {MRI} data acquisition are covered, including the concepts of k-space, undersampling, and aliasing. It is demonstrated that scan time can be reduced by sampling a smaller number of phase encoding lines in k-space; however, without further processing, the resulting images will be degraded by aliasing artifacts. Nearly all modern clinical scanners acquire data from multiple independent receiver coil arrays. Parallel imaging methods exploit properties of these coil arrays to separate aliased pixels in the image domain or to estimate missing k-space data using knowledge of nearby acquired k-space points. Three parallel imaging methods‚Äî{SENSE}, {GRAPPA}, and {SPIRiT}‚Äîare described in detail, since they are employed clinically and form the foundation for more advanced methods. These techniques can be extended to non-Cartesian sampling patterns, where the collected k-space points do not fall on a rectangular grid. Non-Cartesian acquisitions have several beneficial properties, the most important being the appearance of incoherent aliasing artifacts. Recent advances in simultaneous multi-slice imaging are presented next, which use parallel imaging to disentangle images of several slices that have been acquired at once. Parallel imaging can also be employed to accelerate 3D {MRI}, in which a contiguous volume is scanned rather than sequential slices. Another class of phase-constrained parallel imaging methods takes advantage of both image magnitude and phase to achieve better reconstruction performance. Finally, some applications are presented of parallel imaging being used to accelerate {MR} Spectroscopic Imaging.},

There are also many texts written with the clinician in mind that provide an understandable, more general introduction to the basic physical principles of magnetic resonance ({MR}) techniques and applications. There are however very few texts or articles that attempt to provide a basic {MR} physics introduction that is tailored for clinicians using {CMR} in their daily practice. This is the first of two reviews that are intended to cover the essential aspects of {CMR} physics in a way that is understandable and relevant to this group. It begins by explaining the basic physical principles of {MR}, including a description of the main components of an {MR} imaging system and the three types of magnetic field that they generate. The origin and method of production of the {MR} signal in biological systems are explained, focusing in particular on the two tissue magnetisation relaxation properties (T1 and T2) that give rise to signal differences from tissues, showing how they can be exploited to generate image contrast for tissue characterisation. The method most commonly used to localise and encode {MR} signal echoes to form a cross sectional image is described, introducing the concept of k-space and showing how the {MR} signal data stored within it relates to properties within the reconstructed image. Before describing the {CMR} acquisition methods in detail, the basic spin echo and gradient pulse sequences are introduced, identifying the key parameters that influence image contrast, including appearances in the presence of flowing blood, resolution and image acquisition time. The main derivatives of these two pulse sequences used for cardiac imaging are then described in more detail. Two of the key requirements for {CMR} are the need for data acquisition first to be to be synchronised with the subject's {ECG} and to be fast enough for the subject to be able to hold their breath. Methods of {ECG} synchronisation using both triggering and retrospective gating approaches, and accelerated data acquisition using turbo or fast spin echo and gradient echo pulse sequences are therefore outlined in some detail. It is shown how double inversion black blood preparation combined with turbo or fast spin echo pulse sequences acquisition is used to achieve high quality anatomical imaging. For functional cardiac imaging using cine gradient echo pulse sequences two derivatives of the gradient echo pulse sequence; spoiled gradient echo and balanced steady state free precession ({bSSFP}) are compared. In each case key relevant imaging parameters and vendor-specific terms are defined and explained.},

By collecting 2D k-space data in a series of rings, many unique properties are observed. The concentric rings are inherently centric-ordered, provide a smooth weighting in k-space, and enable shorter total scan times. Due to these properties, the concentric rings are well-suited as a readout trajectory for magnetization-prepared studies. When non-Cartesian trajectories are used for {MRI}, off-resonance effects can cause blurring and degrade the image quality. For the concentric rings, off-resonance blur can be corrected by retracing rings near the center of k-space to obtain a field map with no extra excitations, and then employing multifrequency reconstruction. Simulations show that the concentric rings exhibit minimal effects due to T modulation, enable shorter scan times for a Nyquist-sampled dataset than projection-reconstruction imaging or Cartesian 2D Fourier transform (2DFT) imaging, and have more spatially distributed flow and motion properties than Cartesian sampling. Experimental results show that off-resonance blurring can be successfully corrected to obtain high-resolution images. Results also show that concentric rings effectively capture the intended contrast in a magnetization-prepared sequence. Magn Reson Med, 2007. ¬© 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Acquisition times in magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) are typically in the order of minutes. For an image of 256 x 256 pixels, the standard Fourier reconstruction technique used in most commercial imaging systems requires 256 separate free induction decay ({FID}) signals. While the {FID} signal itself is of relatively short duration, the successive {FID} signals are separated by long delays, of the order of seconds, to permit substantial relaxation of the signal before the next excitation. The resultant long acquisition times give rise to motion artefacts, preclude dynamic imaging and keep the patient throughput low. In this paper, we investigate a fast imaging scheme which uses spiral trajectories in the spatial frequency domain. The entire domain can be sampled in a short time, requiring as few as one {FID} acquisition. The scheme requires time varying gradients having the form of a ramped sinusoid. Several reconstruction methods are considered for forming the image from the spatial frequency domain data. The possibility of using multiple spirals to deal with the rapid decay of the {FID} signal is also examined in detail.},

In addition to pure static anatomic information, the evolution of a dynamic process may be visualized by a sequence of temporal snapshots of the process acquired within a short time period. This makes applications like interactive or interventional {MRI} as well as the acquisition of additional functional information feasible. For high temporal resolution, all these applications require a quasi real-time image acquisition during the time the interaction or dynamic process evolves. We present an approach to realtime imaging using a continuous radial acquisition scheme. The intrinsic advantages of radial or projection reconstruction ({PR}) techniques are used to minimize motion-related image distortions. Modifications of the acquisition scheme as well as dedicated reconstruction techniques are used to further reduce the temporal blurring due to the finite acquisition time of one entire data set in our approach.

The T1 relaxation times were measured using a spiral Look-Locker sequence with eight samples along the T1 recovery curve. The T2 relaxation times were measured using a spiral T2 preparation sequence with six echoes. Accuracy and repeatability of the T1 and T2 measurement sequences were verified in phantoms.{RESULTS}. T1 relaxation times in cartilage, muscle, synovial fluid, marrow, and subcutaneous fat at 3.0 T were consistently higher than those measured at 1.5 T. Measured T2 relaxation times were reduced at 3.0 T compared with 1.5 T. Relaxation time measurements in vivo were verified using calculated and measured signal-to-noise results. Relaxation times were used to develop a high-resolution protocol for T2-weighted imaging of the knee at 3.0 T.{CONCLUSION}. {MRI} at 3.0 T can improve resolution and speed in musculoskeletal imaging; however, interactions between field strength and relaxation times need to be considered for optimal image contrast and signal-to-noise ratio. Scanning can be performed in shorter times at 3.0 T using single-average acquisitions. Efficient higher-resolution imaging at 3.0 T can be done by increasing the {TR} to account for increased T1 relaxation times and acquiring thinner slices than at 1.5 T.},

	abstract = {The T1 and T2 relaxation times are the basic parameters behind magnetic resonance imaging. The accurate knowledge of the T1 and T2 values of tissues allows to perform quantitative imaging and to develop and optimize magnetic resonance sequences. A vast extent of methods and sequences has been developed to calculate the T1 and T2 relaxation times of different tissues in diverse centers. Surprisingly, a wide range of values has been reported for similar tissues (e.g. T1 of white matter from 699 to 1735 ms and T2 of fat from 41 to 371 ms), and the true values that represent each speciÔ¨Åc tissue are still unclear, which have deterred their common use in clinical diagnostic imaging. This article presents a comprehensive review of the reported relaxation times in the literature in vivo at 3 T for a large span of tissues. It gives a detailed analysis of the different methods and sequences used to calculate the relaxation times, and it explains the reasons of the spread of reported relaxation times values in the literature.},

Recent advances have suggested that structured or group sparsity often leads to more powerful signal reconstruction techniques in various compressed sensing ({CS}) studies. In this paper, we propose a nonlocal low-rank regularization ({NLR}) approach toward exploiting structured sparsity and explore its application into {CS} of both photographic and {MRI} images. We also propose the use of a nonconvex log det ( X) as a smooth surrogate function for the rank instead of the convex nuclear norm and justify the benefit of such a strategy using extensive experiments. To further improve the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm, we have developed a fast implementation using the alternative direction multiplier method technique. Experimental results have shown that the proposed {NLR}-{CS} algorithm can significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art {CS} techniques for image recovery.},

These priors specify that a convolutional structured matrix, i.e., Toeplitz, Hankel, or their multilevel generalizations, built from Fourier data of the image should be low-rank. The main challenge in applying these schemes to large-scale problems is the computational complexity and memory demand resulting from lifting the image data to a large-scale matrix. We introduce a fast and memory-efficient approach called the generic iterative reweighted annihilation filter algorithm that exploits the convolutional structure of the lifted matrix to work in the original unlifted domain, thus considerably reducing the complexity. Our experiments on the recovery of images from undersampled Fourier measurements show that the resulting algorithm is considerably faster than previously proposed algorithms and can accommodate much larger problem sizes than previously studied.},

	abstract = {Purpose To apply the low-rank plus sparse (L+S) matrix decomposition model to reconstruct undersampled dynamic {MRI} as a superposition of background and dynamic components in various problems of clinical interest. Theory and Methods The L+S model is natural to represent dynamic {MRI} data. Incoherence between k-t space (acquisition) and the singular vectors of L and the sparse domain of S is required to reconstruct undersampled data. Incoherence between L and S is required for robust separation of background and dynamic components. Multicoil L+S reconstruction is formulated using a convex optimization approach, where the nuclear norm is used to enforce low rank in L and the l1 norm is used to enforce sparsity in S. Feasibility of the L+S reconstruction was tested in several dynamic {MRI} experiments with true acceleration, including cardiac perfusion, cardiac cine, time-resolved angiography, and abdominal and breast perfusion using Cartesian and radial sampling. Results The L+S model increased compressibility of dynamic {MRI} data and thus enabled high-acceleration factors. The inherent background separation improved background suppression performance compared to conventional data subtraction, which is sensitive to motion. Conclusion The high acceleration and background separation enabled by L+S promises to enhance spatial and temporal resolution and to enable background suppression without the need of subtraction or modeling.

Although the individual concepts are simple, there are many concepts to learn and retain simultaneously; this situation may give the illusion that learning the physics of {MR} imaging is complicated. It is important for the radiologist who interprets {MR} images to understand the methods used to create the images because image contrast specifically depends on how the image data were acquired. Initial concepts include formation of magnetic fields from electric currents in loops of wire, the resonance phenomenon, the hydrogen proton and its frequency of precession, and absorption of radiofrequency energy. These concepts can then be applied to learn about T1 and T2 relaxation and contrast and how the acquisition parameters of echo time and repetition time can be used to achieve these image contrasts. Basic pulse sequences include the spin-echo, multiecho spin-echo, turbo spin-echo, inversion-recovery, and gradient-recalled-echo sequences.¬© {RSNA}, 2005},

	abstract = {Neuronal activity causes local changes in cerebral blood flow, blood volume, and blood oxygenation. Magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) techniques sensitive to changes in cerebral blood flow and blood oxygenation were developed by high-speed echo planar imaging. These techniques were used to obtain completely noninvasive tomographic maps of human brain activity, by using visual and motor stimulus paradigms. Changes in blood oxygenation were detected by using a gradient echo ({GE}) imaging sequence sensitive to the paramagnetic state of deoxygenated hemoglobin. Blood flow changes were evaluated by a spin-echo inversion recovery ({IR}), tissue relaxation parameter T1-sensitive pulse sequence. A series of images were acquired continuously with the same imaging pulse sequence (either {GE} or {IR}) during task activation. Cine display of subtraction images (activated minus baseline) directly demonstrates activity-induced changes in brain {MR} signal observed at a temporal resolution of seconds. During 8-Hz patterned-flash photic stimulation, a significant increase in signal intensity (paired t test; P less than 0.001) of 1.8\% +/- 0.8\% ({GE}) and 1.8\% +/- 0.9\% ({IR}) was observed in the primary visual cortex (V1) of seven normal volunteers. The mean rise-time constant of the signal change was 4.4 +/- 2.2 s for the {GE} images and 8.9 +/- 2.8 s for the {IR} images. The stimulation frequency dependence of visual activation agrees with previous positron emission tomography observations, with the largest {MR} signal response occurring at 8 Hz. Similar signal changes were observed within the human primary motor cortex (M1) during a hand squeezing task and in animal models of increased blood flow by hypercapnia. By using intrinsic blood-tissue contrast, functional {MRI} opens a spatial-temporal window onto individual brain physiology.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of regional hemodynamics has widespread application for both physiological research and clinical assessment. Here we review the use of {MR} contrast agents to measure tissue perfusion. Two primary mechanisms of image contrast are discussed: relaxivity and susceptibility effects. Relaxivity effects result from dipolar enhancement of T1 and T2 rates. Because tissue T1 rates are intrinsically smaller, the dominant effect is shortening of T1 relaxation times. The second mechanism of image contrast is the variation in tissue magnetic field produced by heterogeneous distribution of high magnetic susceptibility agents. Quantitation of tissue perfusion requires a detailed understanding of the relation between contrast agent concentration and associated {MR} signal changes. Studies to date show a linear relationship between contrast agent concentration and rate change in most organs. The exact nature of this relationship in the dynamic setting of rapid contrast agent passage through the microcirculatory bed is less well established. If this relationship is known, tracer kinetic modeling can be used to calculate regional blood flow and blood volume. Data are presented which indicate that this approach is feasible, and suggest the potential of contrast-enhanced {NMR} for high resolution in vivo mapping of both physiology and anatomy. ¬© 1990 Academic Press, Inc.},

Blood water flowing to the brain is saturated in the neck region with a sliceselective saturation imaging sequence, creating an endogenous tracer in the form of proximally saturated spins. Because proton T1 times are relatively long, particularly at high field strengths, saturated spins exchange with bulk water in the brain and a steady state is created where the regional concentration of saturated spins is determined by the regional blood flow and regional T1. Distal saturation applied equidistantly outside the brain serves as a control for effects of the saturation pulses.

At very high diffusion-sensitizing gradient strengths, no clear evidence of anisotropic water diffusion was found in either cortical or subcortical (basal ganglia) gray matter. Signal intensities clearly dependent on orientation were observed in the cortical and deep white matter of the brain and in the white matter of the spinal cord. Greater signal attenuation (faster diffusion) was observed when the relative orientation of white matter tracts to the diffusion-sensitizing gradient was parallel as compared to that obtained with a perpendicular alignment. These effects were seen on both premortem and immediate postmortem images obtained in all axial, sagittal, and coronal views. Potential applications of this {MR} imaging technique included the stereospecific evaluation of white matter in the brain and spinal cord and in the characterization of demyelinating and dysmyelinating diseases.},

	abstract = {A computational technique for solving fluid problems with free surfaces and interfaces is presented. The conventional cell volume fraction approach is employed for tracking the interfaces. However, for surface advection and its reconstruction, a new and more accurate {FLAIR} (flux line-segment model for advection and interface reconstruction) algorithm is developed. The surface is approximated by a set of line segments fitted at the boundary of every two neighboring computational cells. A criterion is developed for identifying the line-segment orientation by inspecting the cell volume fractions. The new cell volume fraction field is obtained by integrating the advected area underneath the interface line-segment. As an example, this technique is applied to the capillary driven viscous flow of an initially elliptic, two-dimensional fluid zone. The problem is posed mathematically as a solution of the Navier-Stokes equations with moving free surface boundary conditions. The damping motion of the fluid zone is observed through transport of the free surface, which is related to the instantaneous internal velocity field under the influence of surface tension and viscous forces.},

Shortening of the inversion time ({TI}) and creation of a short-{TI} inversion-recovery ({STIR}) pulse sequence increases sensitivity to malignancy and other abnormalities by making the effects of prolonged T1 and T2 on signal intensity additive and by nulling the signal from fat. The authors examined over 300 patients with various malignancies and compared {STIR} images with T1- and T2-weighted images obtained at 0.5 T. In 43 cases, signal-difference-to-noise ratios ({SD}/Ns) were calculated between tumor, fat, and muscle. In general, {STIR} images demonstrated tumor as a conspicuously high-intensity area in a background of muted, discernible anatomic detail. The good contrast achieved with {STIR} sequences between tumor and fat ({SD}/N = 18.1) and tumor and muscle ({SD}/N = 12.9) consolidated into a single image the information contained separately on T1- and T2-weighted images, which facilitates efficient detection and localization of malignancy.},

The frequency of the pulsed r-f power satisfies the condition for nuclear magnetic resonance, and the pulses last for times which are short compared with the time in which the nutating macroscopic magnetic moment of the entire spin ensemble can decay. After removal of the pulses a non-equilibrium configuration of isochromatic macroscopic moments remains in which the moment vectors precess freely. Each moment vector has a magnitude at a given precession frequency which is determined by the distribution of Larmor frequencies imposed upon the ensemble by inhomogeneities in H0. At times determined by pulse sequences applied in the past the constructive interference of these moment vectors gives rise to observable spontaneous nuclear induction signals. The properties and underlying principles of these spin echo signals are discussed with use of the Bloch theory. Relaxation times are measured directly and accurately from the measurement of echo amplitudes. An analysis includes the effect on relaxation measurements of the self-diffusion of liquid molecules which contain resonant nuclei. Preliminary studies are made of several effects associated with spin echoes, including the observed shifts in magnetic resonance frequency of spins due to magnetic shielding of nuclei contained in molecules.},

In recent years, new human {MR} systems have become available operating at static magnetic fields of 7‚ÄØT or higher (‚â•300‚ÄØ{MHz} proton frequency). Imaging human-sized objects at such high frequencies presents several challenges including non-uniform radiofrequency fields, enhanced susceptibility artifacts, and higher radiofrequency energy deposition in the tissue.

Emphasis is given to techniques that particularly benefit from the changing physical characteristics at high magnetic fields, including susceptibility-weighted imaging and phase-contrast techniques, imaging with X-nuclei, {MR} spectroscopy, {CEST} imaging, as well as functional {MRI}.

The high resolution 3D sodium {MRI} with pixels of 0.125 ŒºL allowed for minimizing a partial volume effect often relevant to the {MRI} of low intensity signals. Tumor sodium and diffusion {MRI} were evaluated for two separate subclones of 9L cells with different resistance to 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosurea detected by pre-surgery assays. In vivo, after implantation, resistant 9L cells created tumors with significantly reduced sodium concentrations (57 ¬± 3 {mM}) compared with nonresistant 9L cells (78 ¬± 3 {mM}). The corresponding differences in diffusion were less, but also statistically significant. During tumor progression, an increase of glioma sodium concentration was observed in both cell types with a rate of 2.4‚Äì5.8 \%/day relative to normal brain. Tumor diffusion was not significantly changed at this time, indicative of no alterations in glioma cellularity. Thus, changes in sodium during tumor progression reflect increasing intracellular sodium concentration and mounting metabolic stress.

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for analysis-based sparsity reconstruction. It can solve the generalized problem by structured sparsity regularization with an orthogonal basis and total variation regularization. The proposed algorithm is based on the iterative reweighted least squares ({IRLS}) model, which is further accelerated by the preconditioned conjugate gradient method. The convergence rate of the proposed algorithm is almost the same as that of the traditional {IRLS} algorithms, that is, exponentially fast. Moreover, with the specifically devised preconditioner, the computational cost for each iteration is significantly less than that of traditional {IRLS} algorithms, which enables our approach to handle large scale problems. In addition to the fast convergence, it is straightforward to apply our method to standard sparsity, group sparsity, overlapping group sparsity and {TV} based problems. Experiments are conducted on a practical application: compressive sensing magnetic resonance imaging. Extensive results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves superior performance over 14 state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both accuracy and computational cost.},

	title = {Low Dimensional Methods for High Dimensional Magnetic Resonance Imaging},
	abstract = {Author(s): Ong, Frank {\textbar} Advisor(s): Lustig, Michael {\textbar} Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging ({MRI}) is an amazing imaging modality in many aspects. It offers one of the best imaging contrast for visualizing soft issues. It has no ionizing radiation at all. Its flexibility has also enabled many applications, including assessing blood flow, imaging brain activity via oxygenation contrast, and measuring tissue stiffness. Since {MRI} was invented, this imaging technology has saved numerous lives, and has been the frontier of biomedical and engineering research.On the other hand, imaging speed remains a main limitation of {MRI}. Inherently, {MRI} takes time to collect measurements, and often requires minutes to complete a scan. In this regard, {MRI} is quite similar to early cameras: Subjects have to be motionless for minutes to obtain an image, which is uncomfortable to patients. This often leads to motion and motion artifacts. When severe motion artifacts occur, scans have to be repeated.This dissertation aims to change that by developing techniques to reconstruct three-dimensional (3D) dynamic {MRI} from continuous acquisitions. An ideal 3D dynamic scan would be able to resolve all dynamics at a high spatiotemporal resolution. Subjects would not have to be motionless. The comprehensive information in the single scan would also greatly simplify clinical workflow. While this dissertation has not achieved this ideal scan yet, it proposes several innovations toward this goal. In particular, www.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7464485 shows a 3D rendering of a reconstruction result from this dissertation. Arbitrary slices at different orientation can be selected over time. Respiratory motion, contrast enhancements, and even slight bulk motion can be seen.The main challenge in high resolution 3D dynamic {MRI} is that the reconstruction problem is inherently underdetermined and demanding of computation and memory. To overcome these challenges, this dissertation builds on top of many fundamental methods, including non-Cartesian imaging, parallel imaging and compressed sensing. In particular, this dissertation heavily relies on the compressed sensing framework, which has three components: 1) the image of interest has a compressed signal representation. 2) {MRI} can acquire (pseudo)-randomized samples in k-space, which provides incoherent encoding of the underlying image. 3) sparsity/compressibility can be efficiently enforced in reconstruction to recover the compressed representation from the undersampled measurements.In this dissertation, I propose a multiscale low rank model that can compactly represent dynamic image sequences. The resulting representation can be applied beyond {MRI}, and is useful for other applications, such as motion separation in surveillance video. With the multiscale low rank representation, I propose a technique incorporating stochastic optimization to efficiently reconstruct 3D dynamic {MRI}. This makes it feasible to run such large-scale reconstructions on local workstations. To further speed up the reconstruction time, I propose accelerating the convergence of non-Cartesian reconstruction using a specially designed preconditioner. Finally, I leverage external undersampled datasets to further improve reconstruction quality using convolutional sparse coding.},

An efficient iterative reweighting scheme is proposed for enhancing low rank and sparsity simultaneously and the performance of low-rank matrix recovery is prompted greatly. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed method both on numerical simulations and real images/videos restoration, including single image restoration, hyperspectral image restoration, and background modeling from corrupted observations.

	abstract = {By viewing the nonuniform discrete Fourier transform ({NUDFT}) as a perturbed version of a uniform discrete Fourier transform, we propose a fast, stable, and simple algorithm for computing the {NUDFT} that costs \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(N{\textbackslash}log N{\textbackslash}log(1/{\textbackslash}epsilon)/{\textbackslash}log{\textbackslash}!{\textbackslash}log(1/{\textbackslash}epsilon))\$ operations based on the fast Fourier transform, where \$N\$ is the size of the transform and \$0{\textless}{\textbackslash}epsilon {\textless}1\$ is a working precision. Our key observation is that a {NUDFT} and {DFT} matrix divided entry-by-entry is often well-approximated by a low rank matrix, allowing us to express a {NUDFT} matrix as a sum of diagonally-scaled {DFT} matrices. Our algorithm is simple to implement, automatically adapts to any working precision, and is competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms. In the fully uniform case, our algorithm is essentially the {FFT}. We also describe quasi-optimal algorithms for the inverse {NUDFT} and two-dimensional {NUDFTs}.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a novel algorithm to approximate the matrix with minimum nuclear norm among all matrices obeying a set of convex constraints. This problem may be understood as the convex relaxation of a rank minimization problem and arises in many important applications as in the task of recovering a large matrix from a small subset of its entries (the famous Netflix problem). Off-the-shelf algorithms such as interior point methods are not directly amenable to large problems of this kind with over a million unknown entries. This paper develops a simple first-order and easy-to-implement algorithm that is extremely efficient at addressing problems in which the optimal solution has low rank. The algorithm is iterative, produces a sequence of matrices \${\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{X\}{\textasciicircum}k,{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{Y\}{\textasciicircum}k{\textbackslash}\}\$, and at each step mainly performs a soft-thresholding operation on the singular values of the matrix \${\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{Y\}{\textasciicircum}k\$. There are two remarkable features making this attractive for low-rank matrix completion problems. The first is that the soft-thresholding operation is applied to a sparse matrix; the second is that the rank of the iterates \${\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{X\}{\textasciicircum}k{\textbackslash}\}\$ is empirically nondecreasing. Both these facts allow the algorithm to make use of very minimal storage space and keep the computational cost of each iteration low. On the theoretical side, we provide a convergence analysis showing that the sequence of iterates converges. On the practical side, we provide numerical examples in which \$1,000{\textbackslash}times1,000\$ matrices are recovered in less than a minute on a modest desktop computer. We also demonstrate that our approach is amenable to very large scale problems by recovering matrices of rank about 10 with nearly a billion unknowns from just about 0.4\% of their sampled entries. Our methods are connected with the recent literature on linearized Bregman iterations for \${\textbackslash}ell\_1\$ minimization, and we develop a framework in which one can understand these algorithms in terms of well-known Lagrange multiplier algorithms.},

Solving for the low rank and the sparse components involves nonsmooth composite convex optimization, and algorithms for this problem can be categorized into proximal gradient methods and variable splitting methods. This paper investigates new efficient algorithms for both schemes. While current proximal gradient techniques for the L+S model involve the classical iterative soft thresholding algorithm ({ISTA}), this paper considers two accelerated alternatives, one based on the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm ({FISTA}) and the other with the recent proximal optimized gradient method ({POGM}). In the augmented Lagrangian ({AL}) framework, we propose an efficient variable splitting scheme based on the form of the data acquisition operator, leading to simpler computation than the conjugate gradient approach required by existing {AL} methods. Numerical results suggest faster convergence of the efficient implementations for both frameworks, with {POGM} providing the fastest convergence overall and the practical benefit of being free of algorithm tuning parameters.},

	doi = {10.1109/SAM.2018.8448776},
	abstract = {Compressed Sensing has allowed a significant reduction of acquisition times in {MRI}, especially in the high resolution (e.g., 400 Œºm) context. However, in this setting {CS} must be combined with parallel reception as multichannel coil acquisitions maintain high input signal-to-noise ratio ({SNR}). To get rid of usual parallel imaging limitations (output {SNR} loss), non-Cartesian trajectories provide a gain in sampling efficiency in the {CS} context. In this paper, we propose a self-calibrating {MRI} reconstruction framework that handles variable density sampling. Low resolution sensitivity maps are estimated from the low frequency k-space content using an original and fast method while {MR} images are reconstructed using a nonlinear iterative algorithm, which promotes sparsity in the wavelet domain. As regards the optimization task, we compare three first-order proximal gradient methods: Forward Backward ({FB}), Fast Iterative Soft Thresolding Algorithm ({FISTA}) and Proximal Optimized Gradient Method ({POGM}) and evaluate their respective convergence speed. Comparison with state-of-the-art (i.e., ‚Ñìl-{ESPIRiT}) suggests that our self-calibrating {POGM}-based algorithm outperforms current approaches both in terms of image quality and computing time on several acquired data collected at 7 Tesla and we will focus more specifically on prospective non-Cartesian 8-fold accelerated in vivo Human brain data.},

This review paper summarizes several key models and optimization algorithms for {MR} image reconstruction, including both the type of methods that have {FDA} approval for clinical use, as well as more recent methods being considered in the research community that use data-adaptive regularizers. Many algorithms have been devised that exploit the structure of the system model and regularizers used in {MRI}; this paper strives to collect such algorithms in a single survey.

Some {MR} images such as angiograms are already sparse in the pixel representation; other, more complicated images have a sparse representation in some transform domain‚Äìfor example, in terms of spatial finite-differences or their wavelet coefficients. According to the recently developed mathematical theory of compressed-sensing, images with a sparse representation can be recovered from randomly undersampled k-space data, provided an appropriate nonlinear recovery scheme is used. Intuitively, artifacts due to random undersampling add as noise-like interference. In the sparse transform domain the significant coefficients stand out above the interference. A nonlinear thresholding scheme can recover the sparse coefficients, effectively recovering the image itself. In this article, practical incoherent undersampling schemes are developed and analyzed by means of their aliasing interference. Incoherence is introduced by pseudo-random variable-density undersampling of phase-encodes. The reconstruction is performed by minimizing the ‚Ñì1 norm of a transformed image, subject to data fidelity constraints. Examples demonstrate improved spatial resolution and accelerated acquisition for multislice fast spin-echo brain imaging and 3D contrast enhanced angiography.

Such decomposition is well motivated in practice as data matrices often exhibit local correlations in multiple scales. Concretely, we propose a multi-scale low rank modeling that represents a data matrix as a sum of block-wise low rank matrices with increasing scales of block sizes. We then consider the inverse problem of decomposing the data matrix into its multi-scale low rank components and approach the problem via a convex formulation. Theoretically, we show that under various incoherence conditions, the convex program recovers the multi-scale low rank components {\textbackslash}revised\{either exactly or approximately\}. Practically, we provide guidance on selecting the regularization parameters and incorporate cycle spinning to reduce blocking artifacts. Experimentally, we show that the multi-scale low rank decomposition provides a more intuitive decomposition than conventional low rank methods and demonstrate its effectiveness in four applications, including illumination normalization for face images, motion separation for surveillance videos, multi-scale modeling of the dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and collaborative filtering exploiting age information.},

	abstract = {There is a limitation in the size of an image that can be processed using computationally demanding methods such as e.g. Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNNs}). Some imaging modalities - notably biological and medical - can result in images up to a few gigapixels in size, meaning that they have to be divided into smaller parts, or patches, for processing. However, when performing image segmentation, this may lead to undesirable artefacts, such as edge effects in the final re-combined image. We introduce windowing methods from signal processing to effectively reduce such edge effects. With the assumption that the central part of an image patch often holds richer contextual information than its sides and corners, we reconstruct the prediction by overlapping patches that are being weighted depending on 2-dimensional windows. We compare the results of four different windows: Hann, Bartlett-Hann, Triangular and a recently proposed window by Cui et al., and show that the cosine-based Hann window achieves the best improvement as measured by the Structural Similarity Index ({SSIM}). The proposed windowing method can be used together with any {CNN} model for segmentation without any modification and significantly improves network predictions.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To develop a framework to reconstruct large-scale volumetric dynamic {MRI} from rapid continuous and non-gated acquisitions, with applications to pulmonary and dynamic contrast enhanced ({DCE}) imaging. Theory and Methods: The problem considered here requires recovering hundred-gigabytes of dynamic volumetric image data from a few gigabytes of k-space data, acquired continuously over several minutes. This reconstruction is vastly under-determined, heavily stressing computing resources as well as memory management and storage. To overcome these challenges, we leverage intrinsic three dimensional (3D) trajectories, such as 3D radial and 3D cones, with ordering that incoherently cover time and k-space over the entire acquisition. We then propose two innovations: (1) A compressed representation using multi-scale low rank matrix factorization that constrains the reconstruction problem, and reduces its memory footprint. (2) Stochastic optimization to reduce computation, improve memory locality, and minimize communications between threads and processors. We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method on {DCE} imaging acquired with a golden-angle ordered 3D cones trajectory and pulmonary imaging acquired with a bit-reversed ordered 3D radial trajectory. We compare it with "soft-gated" dynamic reconstruction for {DCE} and respiratory resolved reconstruction for pulmonary imaging. Results: The proposed technique shows transient dynamics that are not seen in gating based methods. When applied to datasets with irregular, or non-repetitive motions, the proposed method displays sharper image features. Conclusion: We demonstrated a method that can reconstruct massive 3D dynamic image series in the extreme undersampling and extreme computation setting.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07472},
	abstract = {We propose a new Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares ({IRLS}) algorithm for the problem of completing or denoising low-rank matrices that are structured, e.g., that possess a Hankel, Toeplitz or block-Hankel/Toeplitz structure. The algorithm optimizes an objective based on a non-convex surrogate of the rank by solving a sequence of quadratic problems. Our strategy combines computational efficiency, as it operates on a lower dimensional generator space of the structured matrices, with high statistical accuracy which can be observed in experiments on hard estimation and completion tasks. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithm {StrucHMIRLS} exhibits an empirical recovery probability close to 1 from fewer samples than the state-of-the-art in a Hankel matrix completion task arising from the problem of spectral super-resolution of badly separated frequencies. Furthermore, we explain how the proposed algorithm for structured low-rank recovery can be used as preprocessing step for improved robustness in frequency or line spectrum estimation problems.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02041},
	abstract = {The task of filling-in or predicting missing entries of a matrix, from a subset of known entries, is known as \${\textbackslash}textit\{matrix completion\}\$. In today's data-driven world, data completion is essential whether it is the main goal or a pre-processing step. In recent work, a modification to the standard nuclear norm minimization for matrix completion has been made to take into account \${\textbackslash}textit\{structural differences\}\$ between observed and unobserved entries. One example of such structural difference is when the probability that an entry is observed or not depends mainly on the value of the entry. We propose adjusting an Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares ({IRLS}) algorithm for low-rank matrix completion to take into account \${\textbackslash}textit\{sparsity-based\}\$ structure in the missing entries. We also present an iterative gradient-projection-based implementation of the algorithm, and present numerical experiments showing that the proposed method often outperforms the {IRLS} algorithm in structured settings.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To develop and evaluate a multiphasic contrast-enhanced {MRI} method called {DIfferential} Sub-sampling with Cartesian Ordering ({DISCO}) for abdominal imaging. Materials and Methods: A three-dimensional, variable density pseudo-random k-space segmentation scheme was developed and combined with a Dixon-based fat-water separation algorithm to generate high temporal resolution images with robust fat suppression and without compromise in spatial resolution or coverage. With institutional review board approval and informed consent, 11 consecutive patients referred for abdominal {MRI} at 3 Tesla (T) were imaged with both {DISCO} and a routine clinical three-dimensional {SPGR}-Dixon ({LAVA} {FLEX}) sequence. All images were graded by two radiologists using quality of fat suppression, severity of artifacts, and overall image quality as scoring criteria. For assessment of arterial phase capture efficiency, the number of temporal phases with angiographic phase and hepatic arterial phase was recorded. Results: There were no significant differences in quality of fat suppression, artifact severity or overall image quality between {DISCO} and {LAVA} {FLEX} images (P {\textgreater} 0.05, Wilcoxon signed rank test). The angiographic and arterial phases were captured in all 11 patients scanned using the {DISCO} acquisition (mean number of phases were two and three, respectively). Conclusion: {DISCO} effectively captures the fast dynamics of abdominal pathology such as hyperenhancing hepatic lesions with a high spatio-temporal resolution. Typically, 1.1 √ó 1.5 √ó 3 mm spatial resolution over 60 slices was achieved with a temporal resolution of 4‚Äì5 s. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2012;35:1484‚Äì1492. ¬© 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},
