	abstract = {Intense radiofrequency power in the form of pulses is applied to an ensemble of spins in a liquid placed in a large static magnetic field H0. The frequency of the pulsed r-f power satisfies the condition for nuclear magnetic resonance, and the pulses last for times which are short compared with the time in which the nutating macroscopic magnetic moment of the entire spin ensemble can decay. After removal of the pulses a non-equilibrium configuration of isochromatic macroscopic moments remains in which the moment vectors precess freely. Each moment vector has a magnitude at a given precession frequency which is determined by the distribution of Larmor frequencies imposed upon the ensemble by inhomogeneities in H0. At times determined by pulse sequences applied in the past the constructive interference of these moment vectors gives rise to observable spontaneous nuclear induction signals. The properties and underlying principles of these spin echo signals are discussed with use of the Bloch theory. Relaxation times are measured directly and accurately from the measurement of echo amplitudes. An analysis includes the effect on relaxation measurements of the self-diffusion of liquid molecules which contain resonant nuclei. Preliminary studies are made of several effects associated with spin echoes, including the observed shifts in magnetic resonance frequency of spins due to magnetic shielding of nuclei contained in molecules.},

	abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopic techniques are widely used in humans both for clinical diagnostic applications and in basic research areas such as cognitive neuroimaging. In recent years, new human MR systems have become available operating at static magnetic fields of 7 T or higher (≥300 MHz proton frequency). Imaging human-sized objects at such high frequencies presents several challenges including non-uniform radiofrequency fields, enhanced susceptibility artifacts, and higher radiofrequency energy deposition in the tissue. On the other side of the scale are gains in signal-to-noise or contrast-to-noise ratio that allow finer structures to be visualized and smaller physiological effects to be detected. This review presents an overview of some of the latest methodological developments in human ultra-high field MRI/MRS as well as associated clinical and scientific applications. Emphasis is given to techniques that particularly benefit from the changing physical characteristics at high magnetic fields, including susceptibility-weighted imaging and phase-contrast techniques, imaging with X-nuclei, MR spectroscopy, CEST imaging, as well as functional MRI. In addition, more general methodological developments such as parallel transmission and motion correction will be discussed that are required to leverage the full potential of higher magnetic fields, and an overview of relevant physiological considerations of human high magnetic field exposure is provided.},

Glioma doubling time was 2.4–2.6 days. Glioma sodium signal was detected using the ultra-short echo time of 0.15 ms. The high resolution 3D sodium MRI with pixels of 0.125 μL allowed for minimizing a partial volume effect often relevant to the MRI of low intensity signals. Tumor sodium and diffusion MRI were evaluated for two separate subclones of 9L cells with different resistance to 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosurea detected by pre-surgery assays. In vivo, after implantation, resistant 9L cells created tumors with significantly reduced sodium concentrations (57 ± 3 mM) compared with nonresistant 9L cells (78 ± 3 mM). The corresponding differences in diffusion were less, but also statistically significant. During tumor progression, an increase of glioma sodium concentration was observed in both cell types with a rate of 2.4–5.8 \%/day relative to normal brain. Tumor diffusion was not significantly changed at this time, indicative of no alterations in glioma cellularity. Thus, changes in sodium during tumor progression reflect increasing intracellular sodium concentration and mounting metabolic stress. These experiments also demonstrate an enhanced sensitivity of sodium MRI to reflect tumor cell resistance. Magn Reson Med, 2011. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

This class of methods, which can be viewed as an extension of the classical gradient algorithm, is attractive due to its simplicity and thus is adequate for solving large-scale problems even with dense matrix data. However, such methods are also known to converge quite slowly. In this paper we present a new fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA) which preserves the computational simplicity of ISTA but with a global rate of convergence which is proven to be signiﬁcantly better, both theoretically and practically. Initial promising numerical results for wavelet-based image deblurring demonstrate the capabilities of FISTA which is shown to be faster than ISTA by several orders of magnitude.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for analysis-based sparsity reconstruction. It can solve the generalized problem by structured sparsity regularization with an orthogonal basis and total variation regularization. The proposed algorithm is based on the iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) model, which is further accelerated by the preconditioned conjugate gradient method. The convergence rate of the proposed algorithm is almost the same as that of the traditional IRLS algorithms, that is, exponentially fast. Moreover, with the specifically devised preconditioner, the computational cost for each iteration is significantly less than that of traditional IRLS algorithms, which enables our approach to handle large scale problems. In addition to the fast convergence, it is straightforward to apply our method to standard sparsity, group sparsity, overlapping group sparsity and TV based problems. Experiments are conducted on a practical application: compressive sensing magnetic resonance imaging. Extensive results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves superior performance over 14 state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both accuracy and computational cost.},

	title = {Low {Dimensional} {Methods} for {High} {Dimensional} {Magnetic} {Resonance} {Imaging}},
	abstract = {Author(s): Ong, Frank {\textbar} Advisor(s): Lustig, Michael {\textbar} Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is an amazing imaging modality in many aspects. It offers one of the best imaging contrast for visualizing soft issues. It has no ionizing radiation at all. Its flexibility has also enabled many applications, including assessing blood flow, imaging brain activity via oxygenation contrast, and measuring tissue stiffness. Since MRI was invented, this imaging technology has saved numerous lives, and has been the frontier of biomedical and engineering research.On the other hand, imaging speed remains a main limitation of MRI. Inherently, MRI takes time to collect measurements, and often requires minutes to complete a scan. In this regard, MRI is quite similar to early cameras: Subjects have to be motionless for minutes to obtain an image, which is uncomfortable to patients. This often leads to motion and motion artifacts. When severe motion artifacts occur, scans have to be repeated.This dissertation aims to change that by developing techniques to reconstruct three-dimensional (3D) dynamic MRI from continuous acquisitions. An ideal 3D dynamic scan would be able to resolve all dynamics at a high spatiotemporal resolution. Subjects would not have to be motionless. The comprehensive information in the single scan would also greatly simplify clinical workflow. While this dissertation has not achieved this ideal scan yet, it proposes several innovations toward this goal. In particular, www.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7464485 shows a 3D rendering of a reconstruction result from this dissertation. Arbitrary slices at different orientation can be selected over time. Respiratory motion, contrast enhancements, and even slight bulk motion can be seen.The main challenge in high resolution 3D dynamic MRI is that the reconstruction problem is inherently underdetermined and demanding of computation and memory. To overcome these challenges, this dissertation builds on top of many fundamental methods, including non-Cartesian imaging, parallel imaging and compressed sensing. In particular, this dissertation heavily relies on the compressed sensing framework, which has three components: 1) the image of interest has a compressed signal representation. 2) MRI can acquire (pseudo)-randomized samples in k-space, which provides incoherent encoding of the underlying image. 3) sparsity/compressibility can be efficiently enforced in reconstruction to recover the compressed representation from the undersampled measurements.In this dissertation, I propose a multiscale low rank model that can compactly represent dynamic image sequences. The resulting representation can be applied beyond MRI, and is useful for other applications, such as motion separation in surveillance video. With the multiscale low rank representation, I propose a technique incorporating stochastic optimization to efficiently reconstruct 3D dynamic MRI. This makes it feasible to run such large-scale reconstructions on local workstations. To further speed up the reconstruction time, I propose accelerating the convergence of non-Cartesian reconstruction using a specially designed preconditioner. Finally, I leverage external undersampled datasets to further improve reconstruction quality using convolutional sparse coding.},

An efficient iterative reweighting scheme is proposed for enhancing low rank and sparsity simultaneously and the performance of low-rank matrix recovery is prompted greatly. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed method both on numerical simulations and real images/videos restoration, including single image restoration, hyperspectral image restoration, and background modeling from corrupted observations. All of these experiments give empirical evidence on significant improvements of the proposed algorithm over previous work on low-rank matrix recovery.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a novel algorithm to approximate the matrix with minimum nuclear norm among all matrices obeying a set of convex constraints. This problem may be understood as the convex relaxation of a rank minimization problem and arises in many important applications as in the task of recovering a large matrix from a small subset of its entries (the famous Netflix problem). Off-the-shelf algorithms such as interior point methods are not directly amenable to large problems of this kind with over a million unknown entries. This paper develops a simple first-order and easy-to-implement algorithm that is extremely efficient at addressing problems in which the optimal solution has low rank. The algorithm is iterative, produces a sequence of matrices \${\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{X\}{\textasciicircum}k,{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{Y\}{\textasciicircum}k{\textbackslash}\}\$, and at each step mainly performs a soft-thresholding operation on the singular values of the matrix \${\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{Y\}{\textasciicircum}k\$. There are two remarkable features making this attractive for low-rank matrix completion problems. The first is that the soft-thresholding operation is applied to a sparse matrix; the second is that the rank of the iterates \${\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{X\}{\textasciicircum}k{\textbackslash}\}\$ is empirically nondecreasing. Both these facts allow the algorithm to make use of very minimal storage space and keep the computational cost of each iteration low. On the theoretical side, we provide a convergence analysis showing that the sequence of iterates converges. On the practical side, we provide numerical examples in which \$1,000{\textbackslash}times1,000\$ matrices are recovered in less than a minute on a modest desktop computer. We also demonstrate that our approach is amenable to very large scale problems by recovering matrices of rank about 10 with nearly a billion unknowns from just about 0.4\% of their sampled entries. Our methods are connected with the recent literature on linearized Bregman iterations for \${\textbackslash}ell\_1\$ minimization, and we develop a framework in which one can understand these algorithms in terms of well-known Lagrange multiplier algorithms.},

This paper investigates new efficient algorithms for both schemes. While current proximal gradient techniques for the L+S model involve the classical iterative soft thresholding algorithm (ISTA), this paper considers two accelerated alternatives, one based on the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA) and the other with the recent proximal optimized gradient method (POGM). In the augmented Lagrangian (AL) framework, we propose an efficient variable splitting scheme based on the form of the data acquisition operator, leading to simpler computation than the conjugate gradient approach required by existing AL methods.

	abstract = {Compressed Sensing has allowed a significant reduction of acquisition times in MRI, especially in the high resolution (e.g., 400 μm) context. However, in this setting CS must be combined with parallel reception as multichannel coil acquisitions maintain high input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To get rid of usual parallel imaging limitations (output SNR loss), non-Cartesian trajectories provide a gain in sampling efficiency in the CS context. In this paper, we propose a self-calibrating MRI reconstruction framework that handles variable density sampling. Low resolution sensitivity maps are estimated from the low frequency k-space content using an original and fast method while MR images are reconstructed using a nonlinear iterative algorithm, which promotes sparsity in the wavelet domain. As regards the optimization task, we compare three first-order proximal gradient methods: Forward Backward (FB), Fast Iterative Soft Thresolding Algorithm (FISTA) and Proximal Optimized Gradient Method (POGM) and evaluate their respective convergence speed. Comparison with state-of-the-art (i.e., ℓl-ESPIRiT) suggests that our self-calibrating POGM-based algorithm outperforms current approaches both in terms of image quality and computing time on several acquired data collected at 7 Tesla and we will focus more specifically on prospective non-Cartesian 8-fold accelerated in vivo Human brain data.},

Roughly 10 years after such methods first appeared in the MRI literature, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved certain compressed sensing methods for commercial use, making compressed sensing a clinical success story for MRI. This review paper summarizes several key models and optimization algorithms for MR image reconstruction, including both the type of methods that have FDA approval for clinical use, as well as more recent methods being considered in the research community that use data-adaptive regularizers. Many algorithms have been devised that exploit the structure of the system model and regularizers used in MRI; this paper strives to collect such algorithms in a single survey. Many of the ideas used in optimization methods for MRI are also useful for solving other inverse problems.},

	abstract = {The sparsity which is implicit in MR images is exploited to significantly undersample k-space. Some MR images such as angiograms are already sparse in the pixel representation; other, more complicated images have a sparse representation in some transform domain–for example, in terms of spatial finite-differences or their wavelet coefficients. According to the recently developed mathematical theory of compressed-sensing, images with a sparse representation can be recovered from randomly undersampled k-space data, provided an appropriate nonlinear recovery scheme is used. Intuitively, artifacts due to random undersampling add as noise-like interference. In the sparse transform domain the significant coefficients stand out above the interference. A nonlinear thresholding scheme can recover the sparse coefficients, effectively recovering the image itself. In this article, practical incoherent undersampling schemes are developed and analyzed by means of their aliasing interference. Incoherence is introduced by pseudo-random variable-density undersampling of phase-encodes. The reconstruction is performed by minimizing the ℓ1 norm of a transformed image, subject to data fidelity constraints. Examples demonstrate improved spatial resolution and accelerated acquisition for multislice fast spin-echo brain imaging and 3D contrast enhanced angiography.

Such decomposition is well motivated in practice as data matrices often exhibit local correlations in multiple scales. Concretely, we propose a multi-scale low rank modeling that represents a data matrix as a sum of block-wise low rank matrices with increasing scales of block sizes. We then consider the inverse problem of decomposing the data matrix into its multi-scale low rank components and approach the problem via a convex formulation. Theoretically, we show that under various incoherence conditions, the convex program recovers the multi-scale low rank components {\textbackslash}revised\{either exactly or approximately\}. Practically, we provide guidance on selecting the regularization parameters and incorporate cycle spinning to reduce blocking artifacts. Experimentally, we show that the multi-scale low rank decomposition provides a more intuitive decomposition than conventional low rank methods and demonstrate its effectiveness in four applications, including illumination normalization for face images, motion separation for surveillance videos, multi-scale modeling of the dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and collaborative filtering exploiting age information.},

	abstract = {There is a limitation in the size of an image that can be processed using computationally demanding methods such as e.g. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Some imaging modalities - notably biological and medical - can result in images up to a few gigapixels in size, meaning that they have to be divided into smaller parts, or patches, for processing. However, when performing image segmentation, this may lead to undesirable artefacts, such as edge effects in the final re-combined image. We introduce windowing methods from signal processing to effectively reduce such edge effects. With the assumption that the central part of an image patch often holds richer contextual information than its sides and corners, we reconstruct the prediction by overlapping patches that are being weighted depending on 2-dimensional windows. We compare the results of four different windows: Hann, Bartlett-Hann, Triangular and a recently proposed window by Cui et al., and show that the cosine-based Hann window achieves the best improvement as measured by the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). The proposed windowing method can be used together with any CNN model for segmentation without any modification and significantly improves network predictions.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To develop a framework to reconstruct large-scale volumetric dynamic MRI from rapid continuous and non-gated acquisitions, with applications to pulmonary and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) imaging. Theory and Methods: The problem considered here requires recovering hundred-gigabytes of dynamic volumetric image data from a few gigabytes of k-space data, acquired continuously over several minutes. This reconstruction is vastly under-determined, heavily stressing computing resources as well as memory management and storage. To overcome these challenges, we leverage intrinsic three dimensional (3D) trajectories, such as 3D radial and 3D cones, with ordering that incoherently cover time and k-space over the entire acquisition. We then propose two innovations: (1) A compressed representation using multi-scale low rank matrix factorization that constrains the reconstruction problem, and reduces its memory footprint. (2) Stochastic optimization to reduce computation, improve memory locality, and minimize communications between threads and processors. We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method on DCE imaging acquired with a golden-angle ordered 3D cones trajectory and pulmonary imaging acquired with a bit-reversed ordered 3D radial trajectory. We compare it with "soft-gated" dynamic reconstruction for DCE and respiratory resolved reconstruction for pulmonary imaging. Results: The proposed technique shows transient dynamics that are not seen in gating based methods. When applied to datasets with irregular, or non-repetitive motions, the proposed method displays sharper image features. Conclusion: We demonstrated a method that can reconstruct massive 3D dynamic image series in the extreme undersampling and extreme computation setting.},

	abstract = {We propose a new Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) algorithm for the problem of completing or denoising low-rank matrices that are structured, e.g., that possess a Hankel, Toeplitz or block-Hankel/Toeplitz structure. The algorithm optimizes an objective based on a non-convex surrogate of the rank by solving a sequence of quadratic problems. Our strategy combines computational efficiency, as it operates on a lower dimensional generator space of the structured matrices, with high statistical accuracy which can be observed in experiments on hard estimation and completion tasks. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithm StrucHMIRLS exhibits an empirical recovery probability close to 1 from fewer samples than the state-of-the-art in a Hankel matrix completion task arising from the problem of spectral super-resolution of badly separated frequencies. Furthermore, we explain how the proposed algorithm for structured low-rank recovery can be used as preprocessing step for improved robustness in frequency or line spectrum estimation problems.},

	abstract = {The task of filling-in or predicting missing entries of a matrix, from a subset of known entries, is known as \${\textbackslash}textit\{matrix completion\}\$. In today's data-driven world, data completion is essential whether it is the main goal or a pre-processing step. In recent work, a modification to the standard nuclear norm minimization for matrix completion has been made to take into account \${\textbackslash}textit\{structural differences\}\$ between observed and unobserved entries. One example of such structural difference is when the probability that an entry is observed or not depends mainly on the value of the entry. We propose adjusting an Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) algorithm for low-rank matrix completion to take into account \${\textbackslash}textit\{sparsity-based\}\$ structure in the missing entries. We also present an iterative gradient-projection-based implementation of the algorithm, and present numerical experiments showing that the proposed method often outperforms the IRLS algorithm in structured settings.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To develop and evaluate a multiphasic contrast-enhanced MRI method called DIfferential Sub-sampling with Cartesian Ordering (DISCO) for abdominal imaging. Materials and Methods: A three-dimensional, variable density pseudo-random k-space segmentation scheme was developed and combined with a Dixon-based fat-water separation algorithm to generate high temporal resolution images with robust fat suppression and without compromise in spatial resolution or coverage. With institutional review board approval and informed consent, 11 consecutive patients referred for abdominal MRI at 3 Tesla (T) were imaged with both DISCO and a routine clinical three-dimensional SPGR-Dixon (LAVA FLEX) sequence. All images were graded by two radiologists using quality of fat suppression, severity of artifacts, and overall image quality as scoring criteria. For assessment of arterial phase capture efficiency, the number of temporal phases with angiographic phase and hepatic arterial phase was recorded. Results: There were no significant differences in quality of fat suppression, artifact severity or overall image quality between DISCO and LAVA FLEX images (P {\textgreater} 0.05, Wilcoxon signed rank test). The angiographic and arterial phases were captured in all 11 patients scanned using the DISCO acquisition (mean number of phases were two and three, respectively). Conclusion: DISCO effectively captures the fast dynamics of abdominal pathology such as hyperenhancing hepatic lesions with a high spatio-temporal resolution. Typically, 1.1 × 1.5 × 3 mm spatial resolution over 60 slices was achieved with a temporal resolution of 4–5 s. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2012;35:1484–1492. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like ancestors in the Cretaceous period, about 140 million years ago, and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists.
Ants form colonies that range in size from a few dozen predatory individuals living in small natural cavities to highly organised colonies that may occupy large territories and consist of millions of individuals. Larger colonies consist of various castes of sterile, wingless females, most of which are workers (ergates), as well as soldiers (dinergates) and other specialised groups. Nearly all ant colonies also have some fertile males called "drones" (aner) and one or more fertile females called "queens" (gynes). The colonies are described as superorganisms because the ants appear to operate as a unified entity, collectively working together to support the colony.

Ants have colonised almost every landmass on Earth. The only places lacking indigenous ants are Antarctica and a few remote or inhospitable islands. Ants thrive in most ecosystems and may form 15–25\% of the terrestrial animal biomass. Their success in so many environments has been attributed to their social organisation and their ability to modify habitats, tap resources, and defend themselves. Their long co-evolution with other species has led to mimetic, commensal, parasitic, and mutualistic relationships.Ant societies have division of labour, communication between individuals, and an ability to solve complex problems. These parallels with human societies have long been an inspiration and subject of study. Many human cultures make use of ants in cuisine, medication, and rituals. Some species are valued in their role as biological pest control agents. Their ability to exploit resources may bring ants into conflict with humans, however, as they can damage crops and invade buildings. Some species, such as the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta), are regarded as invasive species, establishing themselves in areas where they have been introduced accidentally.},
