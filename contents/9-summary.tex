\section{Objectives}

In this thesis work, we considered the classic results as well as the recent advances within of the compressed sensing framework and their application to real life MR imaging. In particular, we closely examined two recent publications presenting state-of-the-art solutions combining conventional techniques with novel ideas. Afterwards, we implemented these algorithms along with a recently invented algorithm from the family of iteratively least squares methods that previously have not been applied to MRI setting yet. Finally, we compared these algorithm with respect to reconstruction power from massively undersampled data and noise tolerance.
