\chapter{Appendix}

Here you can present all the materials that helps the understanding of your work, but either 1) not your work, 2) not necessary to understanding, 3) simply just interesting things not directly related to your topic, or 4) your text already exceeded 120 pages, and need to make it shorter by moving parts to appendix... :D Anyway, if you have a large amount of images, code, or measurement data, it is required to insert them here rather than in chapters. You can have multiple appendices (possible separated into multiple files) according to the content to be attached.
