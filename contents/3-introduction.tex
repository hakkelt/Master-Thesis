\chapter{Introduction}

While the fast evolution of technology profoundly changed today's medicine, unarguably the medical imaging is of the fields which profited the most of the computation power recently became available. And as X-ray radiographs revolutionized medical treatments in the beginning of the 20th century,  the appearance of computer-aided imaging techniques such as computer tomography (CT), diagnostic ultrasonography, positron emisson tomography (PET), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) opened a new horizon drastically increasing the resolution, allowing 3D imaging, providing reliable dynamic recordings, and enhancing images by automated post-processing. In the recent decades radiology evolved to be an interdisciplinary field involving, for instance, molecular biology, nuclear physics, applied mathematics, and computer science besides the classical medical fields such as anatomy, angiology, and cardiology.

\subsection{History of Medical Imaging}
The beginning of the history of medical images dates back to November of 1895 when Wilhelm Conrad RÃ¶ntgen discovered X-rays. Besides the remarkable fact that he was awarded the first Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901, it also signifies the importance of his discovery that up until the 1960's it was the only medical imaging technique available. During the first 60 years of X-ray radiography, it underwent a remarkable development gradually increasing the resolution of images and decreasing the radiation dose that affected both the patients' and the doctors' health. Since the 1920s, visualization of motions (i.e. dynamic imaging) became possible by flouroscopy, although only to a limited extent~\cite{bradley_history_2008}.

While the theoretical background of later advances in medical images were present much earlier, the the introduction to clinical medicine took place only when the computers became powerful enough for image reconstruction tasks concerning both the computational power and the available memory. Therefore, the major breakthrough came only in the 1960-70s, when suddenly multiple imaging techniques were introduced. The first of these methods was the ultrasound imaging devised by Floyd Firestone in 1940 to detect internal flaws in metal castings~\cite{singh_origin_2007}, and used first for medical purposes in 1949 by John Wild~\cite{watts_john_2009}, but it was not until 1961 when David Robinson and George Kossoff developed the first commercially practical water path ultrasonic scanner~\cite{griffiths_historical_nodate}. Also, the concept of emission and transmission tomography was propsed in the late 1950s by David E. Kuhl, Luke Chapman and Roy Edwards, but computer tomography was invented in 1972 by Godfrey Hounsfield and Allan Cormack~\cite{richmond_sir_2004}, and the first PET camera was built for human studies by Edward Hoffman, Michael M. Ter-Pogossian, and Michael E. Phelps in 1973~\cite{noauthor_us_nodate}. Moreover, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging was discovered by Felix Bloch and Edward Purcell in 1946, and Reymond Vahan Damadian proposed the first MR body scanner in 1969. Then Paul Lauterbur had the idea of applying magnetic field gradients in all three dimensions and a back-projection technique to create images in 1971, and he also published the first MRI images: water tubes, a living clam, and the thoracic cavity of a mouse in 1973 and 1974~\cite{rinck_short_2008}. Since then, these computer-aided methods continue to develop at a very fast pace, becoming essential tools for today's practitioners.
