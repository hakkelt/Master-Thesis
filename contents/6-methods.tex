\chapter{Methods}
% The Code of Studies and Exams recommends the following content for this chapter: "Presentation of used methodologies/technologies: In line with the topic of the dissertation, the professional background related to the solution and implementation of the task must be detailed."
% However, you are free to structure the content of your thesis as you want

\section{FunctionOperators package}
Describe this package what I created, and explain why was it useful.
\subsection{Objective}
\subsection{Features}

\section{Implementation of Sparse+Low Rank algorithms}
Re-implementation of Lin \& Fessler paper

\paragraph{What is NUFFT}
\paragraph{Available solutions}
\paragraph{My implementation}

\subsection{Description of algorithm}

\subsection{Optimization possibilities}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Batch-processing: compute NUFFT of all channels at once
    \item Parallelization:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item NUFFT
        \item Algorithm
    \end{enumerate}
    \item GPU-specific optimizations:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Blocking operator might cause CPU bottleneck
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Parallelization Solution}
Details how I made the code run parallel

\section{IRLS Implementation}
