\chapter{Results}
% The Code of Studies and Exams recommends the following content for this chapter: "Evaluation, critical analysis of the implemented technical solutions, possibilities for further development."
% However, you are free to structure the content of your thesis as you want

\section{Sparse + Low Rank Algorithm}
\subsection{Running Speed and Memory Used}
\subsection{Readability}

\section{Multi-scale Algorithm}
\subsection{Running Speed and Memory Used}

\section{ILRS}
\subsection{Comparism with Sparse+Low Rank}
\paragraph{Running speed and memory requirement}
\paragraph{Convergence speed}
\paragraph{Robustness:} Effect of error on the input data
\paragraph{Recovery capability:} Can we reach the same accuracy on recovered image using less data?
