\section{First Order Gradient Methods}

My slideshow about first order methods: \url{https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tIZSSfzzHUgo9tlKlmhSUCCWD3ynzyZwnWtpBUe--6g/edit}

\subsection{Gradient Descent}
From Cauchy to recent explosion of optimization algorithm.

Why would second order methods speed up convergence and why aren't we able to apply them to our problem.

\subsection{Conjugate Gradient}
How do they work, and when can conjugate gradient outperform gradient descent

\subsection{Proximal Methods}
Proximal operator, Iterative Shrinkage/Soft Thresholding Algorithm, Forward-Backward Splitting with linear line search, Wolfe conditions

\subsection{Accelerated Proximal Methods}
Momentum rule and its role in speeding up convergence

\subsection{ADMM}
what is it and why is it good
